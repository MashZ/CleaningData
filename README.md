# CleaningData
Peer assessed course project for Jeff Leek's Geeting and Cleaning Data Coursera MOOC (Jan 2015)

The run_analysis.R code file is the required script with detailed comments outlined in the CodeBook.  

The final step in the R script writes a table to the working directory, named tidyTableAverages.csv, which is attached on the Course Poject submission page.
